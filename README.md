# IMS Project


## Getting Started
This project is an inventory management system that uses Java, Maven and SQL to CREATE, READ, UPDATE and DELETE records from database tables. \n
The database is made up of 4 tables the `CUSTOMER` table is used to store infomation about the customer e.g first name, surname.
The `ITEM` is table is used to store information about the item e.g name, price. 
The `ORDER` table stores information about the order and who is making the order e.g customerId. 
The`ORDER_ITEM` table is used to store the items that are being added to the orders.
